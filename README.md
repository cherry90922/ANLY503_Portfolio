# Xin Lu's ANLY 503 Portfolio

## Introduction & Data
  
In this ANLY 503 Portfolio, there are mainly 2 parts in the portfolio. The first part is all the homework I created for ANLY503 (folder **All_Homework**), which includes coding/visualization exercise for data wrangling (HW4 & HW5), data analysis (HW5), geospatial graph (HW6, not in the folder because it's dropped), and network graph (HW7). All the data used and graphs genereated are included in their own folders. The second part is the final project about Formula 1, which has a website on its own: https://cherry90922.github.io/ANLY503_Portfolio/ where you will find more information about the topic and my analysis and visualizations. There are two main .Rmd used to create all of my graphs in the final project: finalproject.Rmd/.html has all the code, and dashboard.Rmd/.html rendered all graphs generated from finalproject.Rmd/.html into a `flexdashboard`. The data used in the final project is in the folder **data**.
