Driver,Transcript
Charles LECLERC, It feels unbelievable. Already on Wednesday in Milan was just incredible and today to see so many people feels absolutely amazing. Happy with the pole but it’s a shame that at the end there was a big mess. I hoped for the last lap but that was enough with what happened for the pole.
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, I think the pace was quiet good actually during the race simulations in FP2 so it’s looking positive, better than in Spa, so let’s hope for a good race tomorrow."
Lewis HAMILTON," To be honest, I have to be grateful that I’m on the front row. We get to have a fight with the Ferraris tomorrow, which is nice. We’ve split them, so as a team it’s a really good position for us to be in. It is definitely a bit of an anti-climax that we couldn’t all go out and do that last final lap, that’s one of the most exciting ones we have. It’s crazy with this timing that we have, the system we have, where everyone backs up, everyone is trying to get a position and they times us out. They basically timed us out. It’s interesting – get pole position in the first run and then just time everyone out."
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, definitely. I mean on the out lap it’s dangerous for us all. There are people slowing down, you don’t know who is alongside you and that. It’s definitely risky business out there but it’s kind of enjoyable at the same time. But for us we are down on the Ferraris in a straight line, so we particularly need. I think others also do. I think it’s with this new wing, the drag is much bigger this year, so everyone is focusing on that. But honestly just to be up here on the front row, we can give them a good fight tomorrow."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I was quite unlucky there and also I had a yellow flag in the first run in the last corners so I had to lift off and I believe I lost the pole because of that. Obviously the last run was a bit of a mess for everyone. But the pace was good. Happy still to be very much at the front because it’s tomorrow that counts."
Valtteri BOTTAS, It’s always good fun. Definitely enjoying it and for sure I’m going to enjoy tomorrow.
Charles LECLERC," Obviously the feeling I got when I went out of the car, hearing the crowd cheer so loud is absolutely amazing. On the other hand a bit of a shame for the team, Seb couldn’t do his second timed lap; he was very quick. I felt like a 1-2 was an opportunity even though these two guys were extremely quick and it was very, very close. But yeah, the whole qualifying was a big mess with all the slipstreaming and having the best one. But very happy with this pole position."
Charles LECLERC," Yes, I think the race pace was more positive compared to what we had the Friday in Spa, so on that we are pretty confident. But the start will be very important, as always. But there is quite a long way here from the start to the first corner so the start will be very important."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, it’s then same as has happened for some races now. The drag is a big issue here, the tow is a key to getting a good lap. Everyone was slowing right down and also blocking the way, so you couldn’t really get through. It was pretty dangerous. I nearly crashed a couple of times trying to stay out of the way of the guys that were braking ahead of me and then people trying to come past me. Nonetheless, Charles did a great job. I was a little bit unfortunate with Kimi spinning in front of me, so I had to lift in the last corner. That was really our pole lap lost there. It would have been nice to have obviously been able to compete on that last lap, get to really thresh out the cars and see who really had that little edge right at the end."
Lewis HAMILTON," Definitely. Definitely. But I’m sure it’s the same for all of us. The track progresses so you can find little bits here and there. Also, I was quite close behind Kimi, so I was losing out a little bit through the corners, so you are trying to find the right compromise. But tomorrow there’s still a long, long way to the finish line so we’ll try to put ourselves in the best position. This is great for us to be able to separate the Ferraris and we can work together as a team tomorrow and try to overhaul him and fortunately not have the Ferrari in the way this time… Vettel."
Valtteri BOTTAS," It definitely was. I think it was compromised for sure for many drivers so in that kind of messy session it’s always good to be ending up in the top three. The same for me as for Lewis, and I was actually more far back. I had the yellow flags for Kimi so I had to lift off properly and I also feel I lost the pole there. It’s annoying when it could have been possible but it could have been a lot worse today. I hope we can really learn something from the last run because everyone pretty much missed their lap. There were two cars going slow at the front and no one could get by. So not ideal but we are here, very much close to the front and it’s going to be a good fight tomorrow."
Charles LECLERC," To be completely honest, the plan was that, in the first run, Seb was giving me the tow and in the second run, I will give him the tow. So, I actually went out of the box in front of him, and then there was the huge mess after Turns One and Two and the McLaren and a Renault – I don’t know whoever that was – they stopped in the middle of the track and we had nowhere to go. Seb overtakes me there, because of the mess, because obviously we were aware it was quite tight on time, and then I stayed, basically, behind Seb, until the last straight where I’ve heard also on the radio “you can overtake Seb,” so I overtook him – but I had no time for me either to start the lap, so yeah, it was a shame – but I don’t think I could have done much more."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, naturally, you’re listening to your delta, understanding whether you’ve still got time left but I tried to get through… I was supposed to be behind Valtteri but I overtook him, knowing that I needed to get further ahead, but I couldn’t overtake everyone, they were weaving and braking and it was like trying to avoid carnage all the time. So, we had a couple of people I think were holding everyone up, trying to, I guess, let people by but yeah, a bit of an anti-climax, I think, probably for all of you. Maybe they should have extended the session or something like that, so we could finish, or something – I’m not really sure how we’re going to get around this. Everyone’s brake testing and slowing down to let others past, just to get a tow. I’m not sure how we’re going to get around that in the future. But… yeah… in hindsight I wish I just went out earlier. Just got out there and got a clean lap. That would have been great."
Valtteri BOTTAS," No, it’s the same. Same view for me. It was a bit of a mess and I was also just behind other cars, exit of Turn Two, and things started to go very slowly and, short on time, and everyone was pretty much in the same boat."
Lewis HAMILTON," Honestly, I don’t know how many cars were up ahead, so I don’t know… Charles just said it was a couple of other cars up ahead so maybe it was them – but ultimately it worked out well for them. I really don’t know what else to say. It would have been nice to just finish the lap and both put the pedal to the metal but it didn’t happen and we move forwards."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t think it looks good but I’m not a fan so I’ll let the fans decide on that. I think fans get excited,  at least I remember I used to get really excited about watching qualifying and all the way down to that last minute, so it’s down for you guys to have an opinion. For me, just as a driver, I would have loved to have obviously driven more qualifying. One of the best stages of the weekend. I think some drivers didn’t even have a lap – is it true that Seb didn’t even have a lap? Is that right? Yep, it is the way it is."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Well, these two tracks, we’ve seen this is really specific on the tows and I think Spa and Monza are the biggest gains on the straightline speed you can get really, being behind another car, and here especially. So, I don’t think it’s going to be an issue in most of the tracks, like at the next race where, for sure, everyone just tried to find a clear gap. But for tracks like this, it’s always been a bit like that, and maybe now a bit more extreme, with the cars getting more draggier and more of a gain being in the slipstream."
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, as Valtteri said, it’s only on a few tracks during the season where we have this issue. I’ve got no quick fix to try and help this quickly – but maybe we can all think about to to try and understand. It has always been like this. I think slipstream has always been that way. I don’t really know what to say. We just need to analyse a little bit more, the situation. I think today was special, was definitely not the intention from our side. Obviously there was also Seb that was capable of having the pole position and we obviously didn’t want to sacrifice one car for the pole of the other so, yeah, it was quite tricky. I definitely think that situations like after the second corner shouldn’t happen when there are two cars side-by-side. I cannot go at 20kph, we couldn’t pass and I think most of the drivers behind wanted to pass but didn’t have the opportunity so, yeah, these situations have made a big mess towards the end and that’s why so many cars didn’t make it to start their laps. But yeah, that’s it."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t really have an answer, to be honest. I don’t remember every qualifying session this year but it was similar last year, I think. We were all trying to get a gap, which continues to be key. In some places, you want a bigger gap, in some places it’s all about the tow, so each track’s specific. I always through they could do something different on weekends anyways, different weekends, depending on the track but it’s highly unlikely that’s going to happen."
Lewis HAMILTON," I’m sure it’s going to continue. Positioning is key. If we were to… everyone going out as late as we just did there, for example, with two minutes to go, it’s going to continue to be an issue in places where you particularly need a tow. It won’t be until someone crashes that they’ll change it, most likely."
Charles LECLERC," Well, it’s obviously going to be very, very difficult because, first of all, they are quick, secondly, slipstream and DRS are very important here – but I think the race pace looks better than what it was in Spa, so on that we are pretty confident – but for sure it’s going to be very difficult to keep them behind. As I said, I think a very good start from myself and also from Seb will be very important for the good result of the team tomorrow."
Lewis HAMILTON," Honestly I don’t know. It’s not our… it’s the system probably needs to shift a little bit maybe. I don’t think they should start handing out penalties. We just need to look upon it and reflect a little bit and see what we can do to make it better, make it better for the fans and make it less dangerous. Like they already made a change today that we have to finish the out lap within a certain delta time but even that’s still too slow. There’s improvements we can make, for sure, for safety but also for the spectators to watch."
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, I agree and today actually is quite difficult. If you put the penalty to one, you put the penalty to the 10 drivers that were in Q3 because we were all together."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Nothing to say, really."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, obviously a big accident. I saw it afterwards. At least from me… no one asked me if the kerb should be taken off or not but my view would have been for sure because we’ve seen an accident like this so for sure and it was actually not making any difference to the track limits because people were going off the track before the bump so it was in the wrong place and wrong height obviously. I’m sure there’s a lesson learned. It’s a super high-speed place and if you hit it at the wrong angle obviously those kind of things can happen so… Definitely not so good for safety that one but I’m sure something learned today."
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, I think it was maybe a bit pointless to put a kerb like this, once they said they would look at the track limits there, because anyway if you go out, you have your lap and the next lap deleted. But I was quite a fan of gravel there in the past. I think that was quite a good fix for every track limits."
Lewis HAMILTON, Did you drive here with the gravel?
Charles LECLERC," Yup, in Formula 3."
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, I agree with him. It was much better when it was grass and gravel on the exit there because I remember you used to come into that corner, you kind of… you were a bit nervous going in too deep because you might end up in the wall. The grass would pull you out wide and you’d pay the price for pushing beyond the limit. So now you can go beyond the limit and that’s the biggest – for me – the biggest problem with all these run-off areas that are tarmac now. We didn’t need to be consulted about the kerb. It’s a band-aid on the issue of putting tarmac there in the first place. I don’t think they needed tarmac round there."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t really think much of it, to be honest. I thought it was really funny – I think Max is generally a really funny guy so I was cracking up when I saw it. It’s interesting because obviously we know what it’s like – all the drivers have all been here and know what it’s like being criticised from the public and when [they are] in the sport moan about being criticised by people from the outside and then when drivers retire they become those critics, so it’s an interesting dynamic. And also some of those… unfortunately drivers become irrelevant when they retire and ultimate have to hang on to utilise other people’s light to keep them in the light and so… but that’s the way of sport, I guess."
Charles LECLERC," I think they’ve been quick all weekend, to be honest. I expected them to be very quick today. The straightline speeds are not as different compared to Spa. I think we were surprised to see them so quick on the straights during free practice. I think it was the same in qualifying, so yeah, I think it’s been the same from free practice to qualifying."
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, as I said earlier, I think in FP2 the race pace was a bit more positive compared to the race pace that we had in FP2 in Spa. It looks a little bit better but again, here the tow and the DRS has a bigger effect, so it’s going to be difficult to lead."
Lewis HAMILTON," Position is everything, so you want to go quick on the straight so no, you want to take absolutely everything off as possible to go as quick as you can."
Charles LECLERC, Same for us.
Valtteri BOTTAS, Yup.
Charles LECLERC, Thank you so much. What a race. I’ve never been so tired. Can I speak in Italian? (Continues in Italian).
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, I did a few mistakes but at the end I finished first. Very happy with this. I need to be careful with the mistakes but obviously none of them made me lose the position today."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I think we had a good strategy with me and I was able to go pretty long in the first stint and that opened up some opportunities at the end. But I’m gutted, you know. I was trying everything I could to get him and there was no way past. Always when I was getting close enough I started left-front locking, because of the lack of downforce and they are so quick in the straights as well. But I tried and I think it was the best I could do today."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, it was really difficult. We were trying everything we could with engine modes and everything, but not quite enough. Yep, we move on."
Lewis HAMILTON, Fruity?
Lewis HAMILTON," He did a great job. Congratulations to Ferrari and to Charles, he did a great job. A lot of pressure from Valtteri and I. I did the best I could, I think, but obviously following so closely for such a long time the tyres eventually just went off the cliff. Nonetheless, they were just quicker today – much quicker in a straight line, so even"
Lewis HAMILTON," Honestly, I’m just trying to do better each race. I’m not really focused on that at the moment. But of course, a healthier lead than I’ve been in in the past, so obviously I’m grateful for that. But today wasn’t a perfect race. I think this weekend some improvements to be made to my set-up and obviously within myself, so I’ll focus on that for the next race."
Valtteri BOTTAS," First of all, well done Charles. (General laughter, as CL is absent). We tried everything we could today as a team and personally I was giving everything I could for the win. For sure, it’s annoying because it’s so close – finishing less than one second behind the leader. But, yeah, at least I tried everything I could. We tried. The tricky bit was that they were so quick on the straights. It required us to be so close in the corners that it was not really possible to follow, leading the straight (sic), and also getting issues with brakes locking up once getting so close to the car ahead. I was pushing hard, so what can I say? Just not quite enough. Otherwise, it was a good race. I enjoyed it a lot, hunting for the win and the pace was pretty good especially in the second stint."
Lewis HAMILTON," There’s not a lot of pleasure from finishing third. Going backwards is never a great thing. Still, it was a great race. He did a great job. It was nice and tight for a long time and they deserved the win – they did a better job."
Lewis HAMILTON," Uhh, that’s racing. Yeah, it’s just racing I guess. I had to avoid colliding with him a couple of times but I guess that’s how the racing is today. You just move forwards."
Charles LECLERC," It’s quite difficult – a lot going through my mind, during the race, after the race. A lot of emotions. Obviously it was very difficult during the race. Lewis was behind me. I think the biggest gap there was was maybe 1.7 or 1.8 seconds, so right behind me. I knew that Lewis rarely makes mistakes, so obviously I had to stay on it. I did a few, which never cost me a position – once was very, very close. It was crazy and then finally in the last two laps I started to believe that the win was possible. I think that with the traffic Valtteri dropped a little bit and that helped me to get a little bit of space. And then finally going on the line, I let go all my emotions through the radio. I don’t think you can understand anything that I have said on the radio, but it felt absolutely amazing, and the podium also. It’s going beyond all the dreams I’ve had since I was a child. To see so many people cheering for one team, singing all together, it’s amazing."
Charles LECLERC, I don’t know. I think the strategy was good. Obviously we were in a tricky situation because we had the two Mercedes behind and I was the only Ferrari and they could play the game of going long with one car and earlier with the other. It was very tricky but in the end I rthink we made ther right choice with the hard.
Lewis HAMILTON," I mean yeah, if I had gone onto the hard tyre I probably would have had the pace to have finished second, with a tyre that goes longer, but I wouldn’t have changed the position between myself and Charles I think. They were ultimately just a little bit too quick today. I did ask in the morning if I could go to the hard tyres and they said no. They said that because we hadn’t run it they didn’t it was quick enough. I think the tyre we were on was quick but I did say in the meeting this morning that the tyre was potentially going to go off the cliff. It was because I was following so closely behind for so long, just really on the ragged edge, trying to get as close as I could to get in shooting distance of trying to overtake. But every time I opened up the DRS – I don’t know if you were going to a different power mode – but the gap would stay the same. It’s pretty incredible the speed they have on the straights."
Charles LECLERC," The hard were quite difficult to manage. From the beginning, apart from the first two laps, or, no maybe a bit more, maybe three, four laps, I felt quite good, but then there was like a drop off of grip from all four tyres and then I’ve been struggling a little bit with front locks, and towards the end I’ve started to lose the rear, and that’s where the performance started to… where I started to slow down a little bit. They were not in a very bad shape. I believe they could have stayed where they were for quite many laps still – but yeah, I was just struggling with the rear left especially."
Charles LECLERC," Obviously I think since Austria it’s clear that we can go a bit further in the way that we defend and overtake and yeah, just the aggressivity of us drivers. I believe that Austria helped me to change this approach and today it’s also thanks to this that I’ve managed to win. It was obviously very on-the-limit but… yeah, I’m happy to race like this."
Charles LECLERC," I don’t know how you say it in English.  Libération.… yeah, freedom. More or less this. How many laps were there in the race? 53. 53 laps felt a lot longer than 53 laps. As I’ve said, I felt a lot of pressure from behind. So, obviously, from once I crossed the finish line until now is just pure happiness."
Charles LECLERC," We need to stay realistic. I think we expected that Spa and Monza would be very good races for our car but we also know that the next few races will be a lot more difficult for our car. So, we need to be realistic and, yeah, it’s not going to be easy. I think especially Singapore. I think it will be a nice surprise if we are better than what we expect – but what we expect – but we expect to struggle there. We’ll see in two weeks."
Charles LECLERC, I’ve been aware on the radio that I took a black-and-white flag for moving under braking but I’m not so sure of which move you are speaking about. If it’s the one in the right hander where we were flat-out or… after that. What it after that?
Charles LECLERC," OK – to be completely honest, obviously I knew he was on the right, he braked a little bit early which I think was probably on purpose because he didn't’ want to try around the outside. I thought I had left a car width. I haven’t seen the images to be honest. But I was pretty sure there was a car width."
Charles LECLERC," As I’ve said, I think it’s good if we can race harder. Again, I haven’t seen the images so I cannot say particularly in this case but overall I’m happy if we can race harder. So… yeah… I’m fine."
Lewis HAMILTON," We’ve just constantly asked for consistency. So, there was a rule put in place, and then it wasn’t abided by today and they used difference consequences for the rule today but I don't really know why that was the case. It’s motor racing, I guess, and I guess the stewards woke up on a different side of the bed this morning. I don’t know."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, that’s what… Verstappen should have got that last year. We’ve asked for consistency. So the same rule should apply each time – but yeah… I don’t know what else to say about it."
Valtteri BOTTAS," I haven’t seen the whole thing, so I can’t say anything."
Charles LECLERC," Here. I think it’s the first weekend in my life where the only thing I’ve got in my head is winning. Normally I focus on just the job I have to do in the car, which normally is more successful and it works better. But, since Wednesday, seeing the support we’ve had, was just, yeah, incredible. The only thing I wanted this weekend was to win in front of all the guys that are supporting us, for the team. So, it was very difficult because also during the race I was thinking to that win and how much it would mean to everyone in the grandstand here. So it was adding a bit of pressure, and as I’ve explained earlier, also I had quite a lot of pressure from lap one to the last laps."
Charles LECLERC," Well, it felt amazing. I have never had a podium with… I’ve never been on a podium with so many people underneath it. And to see that the whole straight was full of people – mostly red – 99 per cent red – was great to see. Yeah, as I said earlier, hearing them cheering, singing was just… a lot of emotions."
Valtteri BOTTAS," No, it’s not impossible! Not far away today, it just happens that a Finn hasn’t won here. so, maybe one day. Try again next year, obviously. Like I said earlier, I think we tried everything we could and it felt like we maximised everything with the strategy and all – but just not quite enough."
Charles LECLERC," I’m very bad with history and I’ve got a very bad memory for my own races so yeah. For the others races, I really don’t remember anything. The only thing I can remember is maybe one of the first Grand Prix I’ve seen in Monaco, which was at the exit of turn one, I remember looking for the red car. I was playing with the small cars that you have when you are a child – I was maybe five years old or something like this. This is the only memory I have from a Formula One car probably."
Charles LECLERC," I went there with Jules Bianchi, who had to go there for some TV stuff and obviously he tried to let me in with him but they decided I couldn’t go in the factory. Now it’s a little bit easier to go inside but yeah, I remember obviously of dreaming of one day going through these doors and seeing how a Formula One team works, especially Ferrari. But I remember I was very impressed by the way as soon as you arrive in Maranello, which is a city, you can feel that everyone is just here, all working for Ferrari or completely crazy about Ferrari. That was very very special."
Charles LECLERC, No. No. I’ve got a very bad memory!
Charles LECLERC," Well, at the end, if I’m here, it’s also thanks to the FDA. There are a few people in my career who have helped me to get there but definitely the Ferrari Driver Academy is part of these persons or group of persons. We did a lot of mental preparation, physical preparation. They also helped me a lot with the simulator work so I was on the simulator quite a lot and they have tried to give me as much experience that they had from Formula One to me to grow as a better driver so obviously I believe it’s a great proof that the Academy is working properly and there are also a lot of talents coming who are very strong and I’m pretty sure they will come very soon, joining obviously me but all of us in Formula One soon."
Charles LECLERC," Obviously it’s always an easier situation to have two cars instead of one but obviously yesterday Seb was extremely unlucky, he couldn’t do the lap in the second run of Q3 so yeah, but I’m pretty sure it will be better in the next races."
Charles LECLERC," To challenge Lewis and Valtteri will be very difficult because, as I said, I don’t think we will be as competitive as we’ve been in Spa and Monza but let’s see, obviously . I don’t know if I will keep the position ahead of Seb in the drivers’ championship. I think we need to work together and to try and have the best performance for the team. He wants to beat me, I want to beat him as much as he does but yeah, we’ll see at the end of the championship. I can’t know."
Charles LECLERC," On the last two laps I started to see in the grandstand that there was quite a lot of agitation, that all of the fans were jumping so yeah, I was telling myself ‘stop looking at the grandstand, look at the track, focus on what you are doing as a driver and then you can enjoy whatever there is outside.’ But it was quite difficult to stay focused on driving, seeing how much movement there was in the grandstand. And then I haven’t yet seen Seb’s mistake."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Well there’s no point ever giving up when there’s still statistics to say it’s possible. Obviously it’s a bit of a long shot, honestly, if you’re realistic with the way Lewis is performing and the consistency he’s having. But obviously you never know. This is F1, we’ve seen crazy things happening so there’s no point giving up, I just focus as an individual, my best performance I can and for us, as a team, to keep those improvements coming, that we are doing together and by the end of the year we will see, but there’s no point in giving up."
Charles LECLERC," Yeah, definitely. He’s definitely the most complete driver I’ve been in the same team with. I’ve learned a lot from Sebastian. He’s an amazing driver, very quick. He has a lot of experience too so the way he works is very methodical and very detailed and of that I’ve learned a lot."
Lewis HAMILTON," I’m not unhappy; of course, as I’ve said, I don’t like to go backwards but he did a fantastic job today. I gave him as much pressure as I could and we had a couple of close moments, we could probably talk about it in private together but it’s nothing major and we continue to race. I’m looking forward to many more races together."
Charles LECLERC," Maybe on the long straight for like 200 meters, I had the time to think. We were quite quick down the straight… not for the whole straight, only for part of it. I was thinking very quickly."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, it was very low grip. I just tried to stay out of trouble. Of course I had a little touch with Sergio, but he didn’t leave me enough space to basically took himself out. From there onwards, it was raining a little bit and I just tried to keep the car on the track. Once everything was stabilised I overtook the McLaren cars. They had a lot of grip on the first lap, I don’t know how. And then I did my own race. I went onto the medium tyres, we had good pace, but of course the gap was already so big that you can’t really do anything."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, but also they were on the hard tyre and I think that tyre was not amazing. Today the medium tyre was the definitely the best tyre, so it wouldn’t have mattered if I had started on the medium because then I would have lost my time on the hards. Overall we finished where we deserved."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, the opening lap was pretty good. There was a bit of drizzle and some cars behind with the soft tyre had the upper hand but I was pretty pleased I could get the lead. But after that I just had no pace today. I don’t understand why, but no pace."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Of course I tried to defend, but the rate he was trying to close, there was nothing really to do. Like I said, I don’t know why I didn’t have the pace today. I was pushing hard but couldn’t go faster."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I was hoping to extend the first stint a bit and go for the soft at the end but I don’t think it made any difference to the result today."
Lewis HAMILTON," Thank you so much. First of all, I really owe it all to these guys here and back at the factory for their tremendous work. They are continuously innovating and pushing the barrier higher every year, the target, and it’s just been such a privilege working with them and I’m so grateful for all the moments. The reliability has been absolutely incredible, thanks to Mercedes and Petronas and all our partners who are continuously pushing again. No one is sitting back on their success. Everyone is pushing. Pushing and pushing and pushing. That’s the most incredible thing to be surrounded by. It inspires you, that collaboration. There’s nothing quite like it. Today was tough, but it was all about temperatures today and that’s something I was able to, with the set-up, I was able to pre-empt it."
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, I mean they said it was going to rain straight after the race. We got some spitting just at the start. I got a good start but then going into Turn 7 and I got a huge oversteer moment and you know, you didn’t know what was next. I really backed off massively. Arguably, I should have probably tried to defend from Valtteri but I was like “I’ll come back later on” and fortunately that’s what I was able to do."
Lewis HAMILTON," Oh yeah. I mean, you know, it’s an incredibly physical sport but I had a cramp in my right calf. I was lifting quite often down the straight because it was about, like, pull. Pretty painful, but I had to somehow get through it because it is what it is, you can’t lift for the whole lap. You know, I could only have ever dreamed of being where I am today and I didn’t have a magic ball when I chose to come to this team and partner with these great people but here I am and what I can tell you is that I’m trying to make the most of it every single day. Everything that we do together, we are all rowing in the same direction and that’s why you are seeing the success that we are having. My dad’s here, which is amazing and my step mum Linda is here, and Roscoe, it’s a very blessed day."
Lewis HAMILTON," Phew. It’s going to take some time for it to fully sink in, but I was still pushing flat out coming across the line. I’m still very much in race mode mentally. I can’t find the words at the moment."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, thank you. I think ultimately just very proud of the job that I felt I was able to do today and the thing I was able to overcome, but also the job we have done collectively as a team and it’s just reminiscent of the beginning when I joined the team, the decision I took to join the team and what we have done since. Did I think we would get to… I knew that we would win championships. Did I think we would win as many as we have? No. Did I think we would win this many races? Of course not. But it is a phenomenal time for us and the great thing is that it’s not just me that is living with the history, it’s the whole team and I think everyone acknowledges and realises how much they are part of it, so I feel incredibly grateful to my teammates. To Valtteri, for being the contender he is, the team-mate he is, for pushing the team forwards – we’re generally rowing in the same direction whilst we are competing, and it’s been a privilege to work with him. So what a time to be alive."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t believe in the saying the sky’s the limit. It’s just a saying. It depends how much we want it, how much we want to continue to raise the bar and going by our history together, just the way we work, we don’t sit back on our results, we keep working, we keep elevating. Every race feels like the first one. I don’t know how that’s possible after all these races but for me it does, just as challenging as the first, and I think there is a lot more for us to do. Especially as we’re in this crazy time of the pandemic. We’re in a crazy time with having to also utilise our position as a business, as a leader in the business for inclusivity, for diversity, there’s a lot of work to do. So, that keeps me inspired. My team-mates, who are continuously growing, my fans who are continuously learning through this process with us all, and our sport that is slowly changing, it’s a real special time. I definitely sometimes wonder, you know, jeez I’m 35 years old. I still feel physically strong but you still wonder when is it going to tip over and lose performance but showing by today it’s not yet."
Valtteri BOTTAS," First of all I want to say massive congrats to Lewis for this amazing achievement and being part of motorsport history, mate. Actually, some of the interviewers were saying that what do I think about it because many people thought it’s never possible to break the record but that itself is a mistake and I’m sure Lewis always believed it is possible and he’ll just keep going. So, really, hat’s off. Big respect."
Lewis HAMILTON," Thank you mate, appreciate it."
Valtteri BOTTAS," From my side, yeah, it was a tricky race. About the start, definitely the right-hand side was rather slippery but I’m pretty sure it looked a bit weird for the spectators and for the viewers, looking at the first lap but there was actually quite a bit of rain in the first laps, so that’s why the warm up was really poor, especially us being on the Medium tyre, the warm-up was quite a bit weaker than the guys with the soft tyre, so I think I managed to make the most out of it with the Medium tyres in the first few laps but yes, it was tricky."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yes, I did ask for the Soft tyre because I thought it would be, for me, the best thing to do. Something different, as the gap was already pretty big by that point – but then the Medium tyre started to work. We started to have a bit of vibration, which means the tyres are going to be really finished and there’s always a risk of tyre failure, so the safest thing at the end was to go for the Hard, just to obviously get the points. That’s how it went today but fundamentally the main issue for me was lack of pace, which I didn’t quite understand. Just didn’t have the pace today as I’m sure everyone could see. It was a tough, long race without Safety Cars or anything."
Max VERSTAPPEN," We were just talking about it. Lewis says he keeps pushing because he wants to set it very high, because… yeah, I have to work hard to try to get there! It’s amazing. What can you say? It’s just incredible. An incredible achievement. Ninety-two victories and I don’t think it stops there. It will go well over 100. He’s pushing me to go until I’m 40 years old, or something. It’s a good motivation as well. Nah, anyway, it’s incredible. It looks like or course he’s also going for his seven world titles, which is very impressive. Everybody knows he’s very quick but what has also been a very strong point is that he’s also very consistent and very rarely makes a mistake and that’s why I think also he got to this number so quick. Yeah. It’s just very impressive."
Lewis HAMILTON, Thank you mate.
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, it was quite eventful. The first two laps. The start itself was quite OK. I had a good draft and, of course, down to Turn 1, it was quite low-grip into Turn 1, so I had to go a little bit wide. It was hectic also the first lap. I don’t know. In Turn 3 I had to go a bit wide and I had… I think I was behind Lewis but I had Sergio next to me. He was going around the outside in Turn 4 but then, I don’t know, he didn’t leave enough space and basically he took himself out while I was just driving on the normal line and luckily I had no damage – but then of course you lose a bit of momentum, and then I had Charles and Carlos behind, so I had to defend, but then I locked up a bit, so I had to go wide. Yeah, it was a disaster! I had no grip and suddenly those McLarens were flying. They were absolutely flying and I lost positions to them – but I also didn’t want to risk too much, because normally they are not the ones we fight against in the race. But clearly the first lap they were unbelievable. I tried to stay out of trouble a bit, tried to settle down. Then I had Kimi behind me. I was shocked about that because I thought,  “Am I really going to… like, what’s going on?” Kimi was flying, probably his rally driving helped him a bit in the first lap or something because that was pretty impressive. He must have been P6? But anyway, kept him behind, everything settled down. I got into a rhythm, passed the McLarens."
Lewis HAMILTON, Shows you can still do it at 40!
Max VERSTAPPEN," Clearly! That’s going to be so long. I don’t want to think about that yet! I started when I was 17. I don’t want to think about being 40 years old, driving in Formula 1! Anyway, then I got back into P3 and quite quickly my left-front tyre died, so a lot of graining and I had to box. Once I put on the Mediums it was fine. I think the pace wasn’t too bad. Took a few laps to settle in – but also the wind, lap to lap, it was changing quite a lot. One time you would go into a corner and it was fine. Next lap you would have oversteer. So that also didn’t make it easy to really get settled it. Once the tyres were up to temperature the pace was good and I just pulled away from the cars behind and I could do my own race – but of course they were a bit too far away from that point onwards. But anyway, quite eventful in the beginning and of course I’m still happy to be here."
Lewis HAMILTON, Why didn’t you use the Medium?
Max VERSTAPPEN, I don’t had one set for quali and I said I wasn’t going to risk it. I didn't think the Soft was going to be that much of a struggle.
Lewis HAMILTON," I think today… first, when I come to these races I never think of the numbers. I just never let it enter into my thought process. Today was really about… we’re at this track, it’s very, very smooth, you see the struggle we’re all having with the tyre temperatures, so towards the end of the race I was thinking about what I will and won’t say in terms of what is appropriate to say and not to say but ultimately it’s no secret, I think today was about tyre temperature. I felt through the race that I was learning, lap on lap, more about the circuit. I was trying lots of different lines and discovering new lines that worked well. The wind direction was very, very tricky, I think, today, lots of crosswinds, headwinds and tailwinds and there was some positions that you could utilise to your favour and others that kind-of get in the way. I think the key is the times when you have a tailwind, it’s minimising the loss through those stages. Set-up was something that I really focussed on. It was less about qualifying set-up, and more for the race set-up and I think today that enabled me to go one better, I guess, than before. I just felt like I was generally getting faster and faster throughout the race – but I had to keep up the pace for these tyres. That was really the key."
Lewis HAMILTON," So we knew it was going to be tough on the mediums. Actually, I think the engineers… they’re very – kind of – chilled about it. Yeah, it will be tough but you’ll be alright. They, like, send you out… It was very tricky and obviously it start to spit so when you’re often the first car into the corners at the start of a lap when it is spitting, you’re the first one to hit those raindrops, you’re the first one to hit those patches of circuit. It’s different when you’re in second, because you can react, often, to the car ahead but I struggled. I got to turn five which was not so bad but then in turn six I had that massive oversteer moment and realised I still had low grip and Valtteri came by, I was overly cautious, I would say, through seven and kind of just generally let them by into eight, didn’t even defend and he seemed to have more grip than me at that moment. Of course, I didn’t understand why, but I was sure that at some stage I would get there and I knew that it’s a long, long race here, so I just kept my cool and just focused on trying to keep the car, the thing on the track, not make mistakes, and keep myself in the race, keep this guy(Max) behind, because he was also right on my tail. And even on the hard, it was not so easy to get temperatures but it wasn’t as bad as it was at the start of the race."
Lewis HAMILTON," Thank you, yes, I was asking the other guys if they’d experienced anything like it. I generally didn’t drink a lot today and I remember getting into the car thinking I’m probably going to be dehydrated and I just didn’t… I never drink in the race, never. And anyways, I started having small cramp… it’s a very physical circuit but your throttle pedal, there’s lots of bumps, undulations, you’re applying the throttle pretty aggressively for pretty much every lap all the way and you never really get to rest. I was coming out of the last corner, coming round turn 15 onto the straight and I got the feeling that it was about to pull, like you’re pulling a muscle, and it popped and it hurt so much, I had to lift and I didn’t really know what to do, because every time I applied it the pain was there. But of course I can’t stay off the gas, I’ve got to keep going, so it’s just mind over matter, so I just had to keep pushing. It was pretty excruciating for a couple of laps, but then it started to kind of…. I don’t know whether blood starts rushing to it and the adrenalin takes over but I’ve definitely got a bit of a knot in my knee, my calf. Yeah, I will seek medical attention afterwards. Angela is a real physio. A lot of trainers here claim they are real physios but they are not; most of them aren’t physios. Angela’s got…"
Max VERSTAPPEN," She’s got strong hands. She’s quite… she treated me once, it was not so lovely. Well, it was good but not so very enjoyable initially."
Lewis HAMILTON," No, it’s not."
Valtteri BOTTAS," I didn’t really have any big lock-ups so I think it was just that it’s quite common that when a tyre starts to be at the end of its life, it starts vibration so I think it was really just the tyre wear and that forced us to stop at that point."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Well, you just have to accept the situation you’re in, because otherwise you would become a very frustrated person if you don’t accept it, so that’s what I did. That doesn’t mean that every time… you know, I come to a Grand Prix, I always try to get the best out of it and it’s a good motivation.  I can enjoy third or second if I know that I push myself to the limit, I push the car to the limit and I know that the team did everything they could. Like again, I think today they guys did a few amazing pit stops again. Stuff like that motivates me but also motivates them. I take my enjoyment out of that. And in the end of the day, yeah, I mean everybody loves winning, that’s why we are, but if it’s not possible, it’s not possible. Youngest World Champion? I mean at the end of the day, I don’t think that when I’m 40 or 50 years old I care a lot about those kind of things. I just want to look back when I’m at that stage, when I’m 40 or 50 and I look at myself in the mirror and say did you get the most out of yourself? If you can say yes, then I’m happy about that because if that means you win seven titles or whatever or zero, you need a bit of luck for that as well, to be at the right team at the right time. Sometimes it doesn’t work out like that but we’ll see. I still have a few years ahead of me, so hopefully things will change."
Valtteri BOTTAS," It’s a motivation. For me it’s… as I’ve said before, I definitely don’t want anything easy. It’s how I’ve been raced and what is my mindset, that I will always keep going and it’s just great motivation to try and beat him and it’s difficult but I know it’s possible and that’s the thing. And if I give up, it won’t ever be possible and that will be the biggest mistake to do and also what Max said, the main thing is really to give it all you have every single time, make the most out of every situation. Obviously Max is a bit younger, I’m 31 now but I still feel like I’m peaking. I’m not yet there  and hopefully, soon, I will be and I also feel I still have quite a few years and I’ll keep pushing and that’s it. For me it’s very simple."
Max VERSTAPPEN," No, luckily no damage. I was a bit cautious on that lap because I was not sure what was going to happen with the car, if I had damage or not or if something would break but luckily I looked at the car when I jumped out and nothing was damaged, so that was very lucky."
Daniel RICCIARDO," It was a bizarre one. I got into fourth off the start and I felt that was obviously the best we could do with the three at the front. But then Pérez had really good pace. He passed us through the pit sequence and then I think he pitted for the soft at the end with the safety car. We obviously kept track position. I’m not sure what happened to Max but that obviously put us in the fight. Kvyat came out of nowhere in the last few laps, but it was fun. Two podiums in three races as you say. It all just happened very quickly at the end there. It was fun."
Daniel RICCIARDO," He actually just said,  “congrats, but I’m not getting a second tattoo”. So maybe someone else in the team. But today I won’t forget the shoey."
Daniel RICCIARDO, It is. It obviously is pretty difficult for overtaking but the actual circuit itself is awesome. It’s mega.
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I think that made quite a big effect today. The start was good. That was one of the main things to get right today. But on lap 2, suddenly, out of Turn 7, there was debris. I didn’t have time to avoid it…"
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I saw it. I aimed in the middle of the car, at least I tried to no run over that with the tyres but obviously it caused some damage or something that made the car quick difficult to drive."
Valtteri BOTTAS, I was really pushing hard to try to avoid Max getting through. I had to push over my limits and that led to a few mistakes so unlucky.
Lewis HAMILTON," It was an exhausting race, the speed we were having to go. Obviously I had a poor start. It’s just very overwhelming right now because I look at my crew, this team here. And I know all the guys and girls… the men and women back at the factory, back at the factory in Brackley and Brixworth who… They are the unsung heroes. They are the ones that have really grafted away and never given up. They have just continued to push and elevate and innovate. People watching maybe think we are used to it but it always feels like the first with this team and I think that’s because of the spirit and so I am forever grateful to everyone to be a part of it, to be a part of breaking a breaking record like this. No team has done this before. We have a great leader in our team and also a big thank you to Mercedes, Petronas and all of our partners. We wouldn’t be able to do what we do without them."
Lewis HAMILTON," It’s unbelievable. To come back year on year… I’ll tell you, whilst we have great performance it’s not easy to deliver weekend-in, weekend-out, and for everyone, they are so precise with how they take the car apart and put it back together. Whoo! Seven-time champs. That’s something I’m going to be able to tell my grandchildren one day."
Toto WOLFF," Yeah, I’m not so much into numbers but this is something to be proud of really. We have a group that is just amazing together. We’ve stayed together, we’ve tried to push the benchmark to new levels and we’ve achieved that and it’s just a super proud moment with all these guys and being part of it."
TW," Yeah, as long as we stay motivated and energised, and you see that within these guys, then I think we can push it furthermore. There will be competition, no doubt, next year, with Max and Honda trying to do a really good job towards the end of the season, so we are looking forward to a new challenge."
TW," Valtteri had a, I think it was a Ferrari piece or a Racing Point piece, about that size, stuck underneath his car. It was debris his overran on lap two. He couldn’t avoid it."
Lewis HAMILTON, Hahaha! Toe jam!
Daniel RICCIARDO, Not as bad as you thought?
Lewis HAMILTON," It definitely didn’t taste great. I mean I don’t really like Champagne as it is, but it definitely tastes worse. But what’s positive is that Daniel’s mum thinks I was a good sport, so I’m grateful for that. I think Daniel had said that I’d once said never, that I would never do it. So there’s a lesson – never say never. It was a good moment… I don’t know I’m just feeling incredibly proud of this team and you know, to live in a moment where we see a team so successful and to be a part of it is quite phenomenal. Something that it the real honour of my life, working for this team and for all these people back at the two factories, Brixworth and Brackley. You know they really are the unsung heroes that are not on TV every weekend. They’re the guys that are working flat out every day during the weeks, crazy hours, to build and to innovate, to raise the bar, so that we can come here and do what we have done today and this year. I really don’t take it for granted that we have had this success. People could say ‘oh, you must be used to it’, and obviously maybe the fans are used to it, but from working inside the sport, you never get used to it. From tomorrow we’ll be focused on what’s next. We’ll be focusing on how we can be better. On Wednesday we’ll be having a big team meeting, trying to understand what could have been done better. We’ll have an analysis of what the next car looks like and what’s needed to raise the bar with the engine, with the driveability, with the ride, with tyre usage, all these different things. That’s because at the core of this team is some real heart and so a big thank you to everyone."
Lewis HAMILTON," It’s almost more exciting winning the team one. It’s a very strange sport in the sense that it is as team sport but there are two championships and then there is an individual championship, but what is at the core our job is to deliver points and results for the team. So when you win a team championship I think it’s almost better than an individual because it’s something you do collectively, with a large group of people and whilst we are the ones standing on top of the podium we are not above anybody. We are on the same level, we are all part of the chain links. You can tell that everyone is so happy when they get the Constructors’ title. When we do the Christmas party and we celebrate with everyone, everyone just knows that they did a remarkable job and that they have done something that nobody else has done before. That’s cool to be a part of. Even if I was to stop today that would be something that I would be able to share with that large group of people for the rest of my life."
Lewis HAMILTON," It was incredibly intense, very hard, physically quite draining as well, and mentally, mainly because it’s a very fast circuit, very bumpy. Valtteri got a great start. I thought I would get a better start today but it didn’t turn out the way I would have liked and I fell to third. My next strategy was to try and get by the Red Bull but it was just impossible to get close and in trying to get close I was killing the front tyres. So I backed off and just tried to keep within distance. Then Max stopped much earlier than I thought he would and Valtteri stopped to cover him and there was no way I was doing the same. Naturally, at the beginning of the race we get given a bunch of different options of strategy and I understood that if I was in that position the only way to do something was to do something different – to extend as long as I could. But I didn’t know how long that tyre would go, but I think that’s where the race was won today."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, for me it’s crazy to thing that I’ve now been part of the team four years in a row to be part of winning the Constructors’ Championship. It’s quite unreal – but I think everything that Lewis said. For me, I’m just really thinking the same. I’m so proud of every single team member, what they’re doing. All the factories and in the race team. We keep raising the bar for every single team member but we do it united. We support each other but the spirit the team has, it’s making these things possible. And I’m really, really proud to be part of it. I think for all of us in the team, it takes a bit of time to understand what we’re doing and what we are achieving – but we should definitely enjoy it because it is amazing and I’m really proud of everyone. So, thanks team."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Actually it was lap two, out of Turn Seven. Like, on the racing line, I didn’t have enough time to react. I saw a big piece of carbon, so I decided the only chance… what I had to do, what I had time to do was aim at least how to hit it. I decided to go straight over it instead of hitting one of the tyres and possibly getting a puncture but, unluckily, it got stuck on the floor – under the floor – and apparently it was like 50 points of downforce which, in lap time, is quite a big chunk. How it affected me, I would say mainly in high-speed corners. I could feel that the car was sliding a bit and in some brakings it was a bit unpredictable, so sometimes I would lock the wheels and sometimes it would stop pretty quickly. It was not really consistent, the downforce I had in the car. It made it really tricky and I could see I just didn’t quite have the pace and Max was putting a lot of pressure and in the end he got through because I had to push over my limits to try and maintain the position. I had a lock-up and that was it. Not my day. I didn’t have a chance with that debris in the car to fight for the win today, unfortunately. But at least we could secure a 1-2, which is a perfect way to secure the seventh title for the team in a row."
Daniel RICCIARDO," They’ll all pretty good, for sure. As Lewis touched on, with the wins, I’m also not going to take this for granted. It’s the second in three races but I’m as excited as I was in Nürburgring. It was a bit more… I feel it was a bit more unexpected, this one. We were running P5 with roughly 15 laps to go, I think, and then there was the issue with Max, so that brought out the Safety Car. So I guess that put me in fourth on track, and then Pérez pitted which, yeah, obviously I was smiling about because I was ‘well, that’s given me third on track’ and I knew hanging on with the Hard on the restart was going to be tricky but I was more than happy to fight for it at the end. Track position’s obviously very important around here, so yeah, I think both myself and the team were very willing to keep me out on track. We held on. I think the threat at the end was Kvyat and that was very surprising. I wasn’t sure where he came from but I was told he was on the Soft and he was coming on obviously very strong – but held on and just very, very happy. It’s pretty surreal actually, the first one and to get two now in such close proximity. It’s awesome."
Daniel RICCIARDO," OK. It’s so close! That’s awesome. Obviously I saw Esteban off fairly early in the race I believe with a mechanical, so that’s a shame. I don’t know where he was on track but I know he would have had the pace to collect points today I’m sure. So, obviously it’s great that we got big points with one car but I think if we’re going to keep our nose in front for sure we need both cars in the points. It’s a shame, I guess he had some reliability issues today but still got a few races to go and I think we’ll fight until the end for sure – so I’m excited for that."
Lewis HAMILTON," The start, I don’t really know. Just poor grip and… I’d have to look back it but it just felt like it wasn’t particularly fast and obviously I lost ground to both Valtteri and Max. Max, I think, was fortunate to be in P3. In hindsight I could have done a different job. Now I know. Hindsight’s a great thing but I’ll know for next time. And delta, I think just overly cautious and, for whatever reason, the Safety Car was out and the delta wasn’t an issue at that point. We were quite down on the delta."
Lewis HAMILTON," There’s been a lot of changes over the time. What’s really crazy – for me – is that I was brought in, ultimately, to replace Michael, which was such a strange position to be in because, obviously, I’d watched this man dominate the sport and achieve such great things and he was stopping and I was going to be taking his place. The guys that I worked with were his previous mechanics and engineers and what a privileged position to be in. However, they had had quite a difficult time and the car hadn’t been good. I think what was really great was that, when I joined, I was personally able to put my stamp on the car and make a lot of alterations, particularly in 2013. And then we just collectively worked together. I knew that we would have a great engine because they had already started developing the engine before I’d even made my decision to join the team, before I’d signed the contract. Being that I was with Mercedes at McLaren, I was able to go to the factory, I knew what Mercedes was doing, I knew that McLaren was coming out of contract with Mercedes and I knew that I wanted to be with Mercedes-Benz because I think it’s such an iconic brand and I think they were so passionate about what they wanted to achieve. They’ve got such a great history and I knew that they had the power to turn things around. But it took so many incredibly hard working people to collectively come together to really innovate and design some incredibly… some of the most incredible bits of the car… to come together… the puzzle. It’s obviously a big puzzle. To watch it all come together is a real joy and, at the end of the day, there’s only two of us that get to drive it. I think also, the guys are just very level-headed. Even when you’re on the podium, the guys are never too overly-excited. They’re not out celebrating; they’re back at their desks already right now. I know for sure they’ll be back at their desks right now, already doing emails, working on what spares there are for the next race, working on what’s next to try to get ahead of the curve. And that’s what this team’s always been about."
Lewis HAMILTON," I thought that he was so I was a bit surprised. I thought that’s why he was at the front. We very rarely see him at the front there and he came and did an interview, so I thought that he was coming up – but I think whilst it would have been nice for him to be up there with us, I think that’s a real showing of a leader. He’s not trying to be at the front of every photo. He’s not trying to claim anything. He puts the team first. I think that’s… without doubt he is the best leader here. It doesn’t matter what anyone says, no-one has done as good a job as he has. I think it’s his mentality, the balance of drive, compassion, understanding and ego. All of them come together to create the best boss you could have. Every single person in the team, no-one’s below him, and he really cares about how everyone is doing,  ‘how’re things away from the track?’, ‘how’s things at home with your family – is there anything we can do so you can be better at the office?’ He’s a great guy and I feel privileged to have him as our leader. We wouldn’t have been able to do this without his guidance."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t even know if I’m going to be here next year so it’s not really a concern for me at the moment. No, I think I understand and we have a lot of deep conversations, Toto and I, so I’m very, very aware of where he is mentally and we share a lot of … and carry a lot of the weight together, I think. Jeez, yeah, I’ve been in a long, long time. I can definitely understand wanting to pull back and give more time to family and those things. I don’t know who he would replaced but again, he’s a leader, he’s not going to put anyone that’s not going to be able to do the job, not going to be up to it, who’s not going to be geared up. He will find the right people. That’s why we have the success we have, we’ve found the right people and put them in the position to be able to shine as bright as possible. He’s just empowered every single person in the team, to be the best they can be. So he will find somebody that’s able to take on and continue… But you know, it’s not one person. The team is not about one person, it’s a collective of a lot of people. Toto doesn’t build the car, it’s a real team effort. But I’m supportive of him, whatever he wants to do, moving forwards."
Valtteri BOTTAS," I think, to be honest, Lewis said everything. I just copy paste it, because I really think the same, that he’s going to be a tough guy to replace in the future and the way he leads the team, he’s a smart guy and he knows exactly what kind of support each team member needs, how much they need, criticism and how to help them to be a better version of themselves and that applies to every single team member and he can really read people well and he’s supportive and he’s done something incredible and I’m fortunate that I’ve known him since 2008 so quite some long time now and he was a bit part of my early career as well. He’s a great guy and whatever he’s going to do in the future I’m going to respect that as well because in the end you’re living for yourself in this life and that’s how it goes."
Valtteri BOTTAS," It was two different scenarios, I would say. We went through the plans this morning, what happens if one of us gets under pressure and there’s a possibility that Red Bull could undercut and that was me today, so obviously I had to react and it would have been the same case if I was in Lewis’s position that the only thing I wanted to do is to go long and seek the opportunities and it really paid off for Lewis today and if we were the other way round it would have been the same for me. Obviously Lewis, he had the pace advantage, I think, honestly, partly, for sure today because of the debris I had but we were pretty strong but two completely different scenarios and actually in Portimao, even though I asked for the soft but I couldn’t achieve the target lap anyway, to get the soft to last until the end. The racing intent is good and is working and we are following the rules and it’s completely fair. It’s one of the thing that allows us as a team to actually do the things that we’re doing."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Actually, I got a warning from my engineers that they could see some gravel, maybe, on lap two in turn seven because they could see some kind of warning somewhere but there was no yellow flag but it was big piece of debris and I didn’t have enough time to react, to go around it so I would have time to decide how I’m going to hit the debris and I decided to go, like, straight over instead of with the tyres. Yeah, it would be good to get more of an understanding why there was not any sign of big piece of carbon because obviously it’s dangerous if there’s flying things around but it sure didn’t help my race today."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, every trophy does, for sure. When we came back, just before we came in the podium, we saw there was a lady there doing the engraving, which is probably the first time I’ve seen that being done, just before… do they always do that? There was a time when trophies were… when you’re from the young days, from karting, little plastic… but they’re so special, they all had such a great meaning and then as you get through the categories they would get nicer, they would get more expensive and you got to Formula 1 and they were so stunning and… but then we went through a patch where they really did a cost-cutting scheme and we had some really dodgy, really flimsy trophies, those ones did not survive the time but this one, particularly, I think, being that we’ve not had a race here for a long time, it is where I remember the day when I was in karting in ’94 at Rye House when Ayrton passed away so to think that we’re here, 26 year, whatever it is, 26 years later and to be able to win here as he had done many times and so yes, the trophy definitely is a keeper and it felt it had good weight to it so it felt like a… it didn’t feel like a cheapy."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, we’re in November and I’m still… it’s crazy that it’s Christmas isn’t that far away. Naturally, I feel great, I still feel very strong, I feel like I could keep going for plenty of months but you know, you mentioned about Toto and shelf-life so there’s multiple things that do stay on the top of my mind but I would like to be here next year but there’s no guarantee of that, for sure. There’s a lot that excites me of the after life so time will tell."
Lewis HAMILTON," We, as a team, have done such a remarkable job, so I fully acknowledge that it’s a collective and we wouldn’t be able to get these one-twos if it wasn’t for these great people behind us. But still, I’ve got a phenomenal driver and teammate who comes in weekend in and weekend out and makes my life very very difficult and so this year, I think it’s… being that you’ve seen the different steps that Valtteri’s taken, he’s getting stronger and stronger, he’s picking up his game, every year, it’s been a great challenge to race alongside him. I definitely think these last couple of years I’ve been able to step into a different… really step it up, quite big strides, I would say, in positive areas and I think that’s come with age. I’m getting older now and whilst not letting my physical side drop off, I’ve been able to really… you’ve seen in the race today… I think getting stronger which feels good. I think this year has been feeling that, being getting stronger and stronger. Definitely really proud of this year’s performances but I couldn’t have done it without these great people working behind me who really provide us with the solid foundation of a reliable car, a fast car, to do what we’ve done, so it’s pretty awesome."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, I think overall it was a good race. I was just trying to follow Lewis, once Valtteri of course dropped out. I think the pace was good. We were just trying to do our own race a little bit. They were just a little bit too fast. But last lap, I thought “I’m just going to give it a go” and see what happens and we just managed to get that fastest lap but also that one extra point. So yeah, I was pretty about that."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, the track is very cold and the tyres are already cold when you leave from the box. I just didn’t understand why the Safety Car was out for so long. The car was cleared. I understand they want to bunch up the field, but it’s pretty dangerous with these cars when the tyres are so cold. We’ll look into that but anyway we finished second, where I think we belong today, and that’s the most important thing."
Daniel RICCIARDO," Yeah, it’s been a while. To be honest it feels like the first podium all over again. It’s been two and a half years or something. The feeling is really nice. It’s fresh, so, wow! So happy and obviously to see everyone as well – we have all waited a long time for this, so I think everyone is going to soak it up."
Daniel RICCIARDO," Yeah, so it’s real. It’s going to happen. We’ll have to do some thinking now. Probably something to do with me but I think with a German flavour. This is obviously the place we did it so a little tip of the hat to something traditional in Germany as well."
Lewis HAMILTON," I had a good start and got up alongside Valtteri and we both like understeered into the corner. So I tried to give as much room as possible and then he was in my blind spot so I didn’t know where he was after that. I moved as wide to the outside but he came back and he did an amazing job and I remember coming out of that corner thinking,  “Good on you, man. I’m impressed. That was good.” After that I just had to make sure… I tried to hang on to him as far as that was possible. I managed to look after my tyres really well, and I could see he was graining his front tyres and I knew those next couple of laps were the time for me to push and then he had his lock-up. But it was not an easy race at all. The Red Bulls are so fast. Max drove extremely well. I think the one place and chance he had was at the re-start but I managed to pull away and pull a nice gap. But you can say their pace at the end. We’ve got a serious fight on our hands."
Lewis HAMILTON," No, absolutely. I’m telling you, I’m knackered."
Mick SCHUMACHER, Congratulations and this is for you from all of us. It’s a great achievement really.
Lewis HAMILTON, I’m honoured man.
Mick SCHUMACHER, It’s a race helmet from 2012.
Lewis HAMILTON," Thank you. It’s such an honour. I totally appreciate that, thank you."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t know even what to say. You know, when you grow up watching someone and you idolise them, not just in terms of the quality of driver they are but that they are able to continuously do [it] year on year, race on race, week on week, with their team. I remember playing [as] Michael on a game called Grand Prix 2 I think it was. I think there was a time I was playing you at one stage too. Just seeing his dominance for so long I don’t think anyone, and especially me, could imagine that I’d be anywhere near Michael in terms of records. It’s going to take me some time to get used to it. Honestly as I came into the pit lane it was only then that I realised that I had equalled it. I hadn’t even computed it. I mean I couldn’t have done it without this incredible team, everyone continuing to push behind me and giving it their everything. So a big, big thank you and huge respect to Michael."
Lewis HAMILTON," It’s definitely not sunk in, that’s for sure. I don’t know how it is for other drivers when they have these wins but it takes some time for you to analyse it and for it to sink in, to realise what it actually means. But like all of us, I grew up watching Michael win all of those grands prix and I couldn’t have fathomed equalling him. I think getting to Formula 1 was the first step of the dream and obviously emulating Ayrton. But Michael was just so far ahead. It’s beyond my wildest dreams to think that I’m here today having equalled him and I just feel really humbled by the moment and the opportunity I was given when I was 13 by Mercedes to join this team and I feel really proud to continue to represent them and to have brought this record to Mercedes. Hopefully we have got more records to break and to make. Hopefully they know it was a good investment!"
Lewis HAMILTON," Naturally everyone knows that he is a legend and an icon of the sport. I think what he achieved in so many areas but your know pushing the limit in terms of the physicality side, he really was a pioneer in being the fittest driver at the time, and what he did at both the teams he was at, particularly Ferrari, was just remarkable. I think for me, that number is so big it’s hard for people to, when it’s so far away, it’s hard for people to perhaps fully understand how hard it was for him to have got those 91 wins, to deliver weekend in weekend out, year on year on year, and stay so physically in shape and so precise. I understand that now more than ever. I can only tell you that it doesn’t get easier. From you first win to your 91st I’m telling you it’s been a long hard run. I’ve got great drivers around me who I’m enjoying racing. I’m hope that it’s closer between us moving… Daniel did a great job, but Max drove exceptionally well also today and applied so much pressure. But Michael is and always will be a legend of the sport and I feel very humbled to have one of his helmets and honoured."
Max VERSTAPPEN," Yeah, it was good. I tried to follow Lewis around the whole race. I think he was a bit faster the whole race but from our side overall it was a positive weekend, so very pleased with that. You just keep on working to try to close the gap further."
Max VERSTAPPEN," It felt… yeah we brought new parts to the car so the car definitely improved. So yeah, we’ll try and keep learning more about it because, of course, the weekend was a bit shorter than expected and we’ll try to improve further and, of course, the next race we can try it all over again."
Daniel RICCIARDO," It honestly feels like the first podium. I’ll say it all over again. These emotions. There’s like that feeling when you get out of the car and go and hug the team, getting slapped on the helmet, getting a nice headache, it’s a bit of a shock happiness but we know we did it. I think as well, it’s the first one with Renault, so the first podium with a new crew but, as you touched on, it’s been two-and-a-half years since I was in one of these post race press conferences, so it’s been a while. It’s a feeling I’ve missed. I feel we’ve been knocking on the door, particularly the last four-five races we’ve been so close and finally had the opportunity and we took it. I felt it was coming and it’s nice to have made it happen, so very, very happy for everyone. To see Renault there down below the podium, I know it’s a big day for everyone."
Lewis HAMILTON," Hopefully you know me well enough by now to know that I never do. I think it definitely doesn’t feel like a relief. I think… I don’t know why. It doesn’t feel that way at all. I think I just feel very… I’m just thinking about all the people that have helped me get to this place. If you see on the podium with me, Stevo [Stephen Lord – Race Team Coordinator] had been with me every single race in Formula 1. He moved with me from McLaren to Mercedes and he’s been with me through every single one of those 91 wins, which is… the journey that you go on with so many people is what really matters and what really counts. Of course the number is great but I think what we collectively have done, I’m just unbelievably grateful to Mercedes for giving a young black boy a chance when I was 13 years old and supporting me all the way. Of course we still have many races to go. I think Red Bull as well as Renault have really picked-up their game and closed the gap so we’ve got to continue to keep our heads down. I definitely didn’t think coming into this weekend that I would have the lead that I now have. Valtteri was incredibly unlucky today – I don’t know exactly what happened. I’m grateful that I got to have that bit of a fight with him on the track but I know that he will… so many different things in this crazy pandemic can still happen so I’ve got to focus on staying healthy and continue to try to deliver weekends like this one."
Daniel RICCIARDO," It was going to be tight. I was trying to manage a little bit the tyres to have something at the end but he started to catch me, on some laps a second a lap. So, I was then trying to pick up the pace and not to be vulnerable too early. There was a discussion,  do we pit or not? But, I think if there wasn't a Safety Car, I think we would have stayed out and tried to have held on – at least put up a fight. I think, you know, if you pit and then don’t… if the tyres don’t have much of an advantage and we don’t get on the back of Pérez, then some could say you had the track position and you gave it up. So, I think in that position we would have taken the risk. And it would have been very close. I was a little bit mixed to see the Safety Car because I knew it was going to bunch us up – but obviously it put us all on the same tyre, so obviously it maybe helped us hang on at the end. Something like that!"
Daniel RICCIARDO," Yeah. It’s a good point. I think there’s going to be a lot of brainstorming to do for Cyril’s tattoo. I’m sure he’s going to be excited. The first one is always a fun one. We’ll think of some things – but yeah, could be this! The car. It’s certainly, I think, from the start of the year, it’s been a new car from last year in terms of it’s been a lot better. The rear of the car has picked up a lot of downforce, so that’s given us drivers confidence to nail the throttle and get off the corner better. It was around Silverstone I think we had a few updates and that really just felt like we were able to basically find a bit more ease in setting the car up and it wasn’t so hit-or-miss. Last year I felt we, at times, could be very fast or well outside the top ten. I think now we’re just able to sit in that sweet spot and obviously the performance is there. It’s proven now,  we’ve done it on low downforce, high downforce circuits. So, yeah, I think it’s a good package and we should have confidence now for the remainder of the season."
Max VERSTAPPEN, Simply lovely!
Lewis HAMILTON, That’s an awkward question to ask!
Max VERSTAPPEN," It’s an incredible achievement because I think, like Lewis already said, 91 wins, everyone thought that was almost impossible to reach, right? To be there now, himself, it’s incredible and very impressive. And I’m pretty sure there will be some more victories coming his way – and probably also Championships. So, yep, just very impressive. And hard to beat."
Daniel RICCIARDO," yeah, absolutely. Tip of the hat at the very least. I don’t think that’s enough. Ninety-one is like… I don’t know… it’s just… even 91 years, you’re talking nearly five years worth of races, four and a half. That gives perspective. How much success Lewis has now had. Obviously Michael as well. To do it, week-in, week-out as well, and year-on. His career now has been well over a decade in the sport and to keep coming back and to show that level of consistency at the front. That’s also not easy. I think us up here I think we understand that. You can have a package and a car to do it, but it’s doing it every weekend when the lights go out. It’s easier said than done. Certainly big respect. I think also the gift that he received, one of Michael’s helmets, that’s one of the coolest gifts I’ve ever seen in the sport, so, it’s really nice to see that today."
Lewis HAMILTON," It’s been every decade in this sport. I think it’s pretty impossible to say what is the hardest moment because like all of us, all of us as individuals, we all go through multiple difficult moments, particularly when it comes to making big decisions. I think that whilst it looks great now, when choosing to move to Mercedes, everyone spoke so negatively about the decision to move and I don’t know how, but not for a moment did I ever think… I knew that it was the right decision for me and I wanted to be a part of that journey. I’ve grown with a team that’s hungry for success but I would say that’s one of the most difficult moments, because I’d been a very loyal person, I think. I was with McLaren-Mercedes since I was 13 so to decide to leave a team that’s given me a place in the sport was very, very difficult for me and to call your boss and tell him that you’re leaving, it was damaging and just emotionally difficult. But then I’m still with Mercedes, every win and every race that I’ve done has been powered by Mercedes and for that I’m incredibly grateful."
Lewis HAMILTON," Yes, of course. I actually already have one of Michael’s helmets. He and I… one of the really, really special moments for me was in Abu Dhabi 2012. I went over to the Mercedes hospitality and met with Michael and we exchanged helmets and that for me was a moment that I will never forget, to stand with someone who I grow up watching on TV and having the honour of exchanging jerseys or helmets, it’s what us sportsmen do and it’s the highest sign of respect that I can think you can really show. So to have the legend of the sport do that with me was really special. But to have his family honour me today, I’m just incredibly humbled. You know his son is such a great bright talent and just a really genuine human being so Michael’s obviously raised a great man in him and I look forward to seeing how his career will look moving forwards. Yeah, but now I have two special helmets from Michael in my small living room."
Lewis HAMILTON," Ah, that’s a good question. Ultimately I think you just have to be grateful for all that you… to this point, what I have of course I can set goals and I’ll continue to charge on and try to see what is possible. I think I’ve got the best team behind me, who continuously inspire me. Each year I come back to the factory and see these guys pumped up and focused and being incredibly smart and innovative every year. And also just so welcoming to me you know. You would have thought that after all this time we’d get fed up with each other but we don’t, there’s a real love within this team and I’m grateful for that. I think for me, like everyone here, I love doing what I do. I love the challenge. It is so hard and I think I would be willing to say there’s potentially not enough respect that is probably given to all these drivers who dedicate their lives in terms of preparation, the amount of work that goes on n the background to be able to do what all of us do in this sport, past and present, is really remarkable and I love being a part of that. I love that challenge, I love the challenge that Max gave me today. I love seeing him behind me, seeing the challenge that Daniel gave Max also, the sport, the smell of it, the whole aura and atmosphere it creates is going to be difficult to let it go. But I do feel, whilst I’m older than these guys, I feel as young as them, at least, in spirit. I’m still very much a kid when I’m off the camera. That will probably change when I start seeing grey hairs and stuff but I’m good for now."
Max VERSTAPPEN, You can dye it.
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, exactly."
TC," Lewis, of the 91 wins, do you have a favourite?"
Lewis HAMILTON," I think my first will always be a stand-out moment for me because really just… again, I always try to relate it to everyone because I think we can all understand what it’s like when you’re a kid dreaming to be there and my Dad sacrificed so much to… and my Mum and my step-Mum… sacrificed so much to get me to Formula 1 so to be on top of the podium, I felt like I’d finally reached the top of the mountain, but all the different slides and things and adversity we faced, I just will never forget that moment, looking down at my Dad and to get finally… I’ve made him proud, perhaps today, so I will always remember that moment, and also it solidifies the amazing support and belief that McLaren and Ron and Mercedes had in me from the get-go."
Max VERSTAPPEN," The race itself, in general, was fine. You had to get the tyres to work, was a bit more difficult initially but the rest was fine. For once we had a cold drink while driving. That’s nice. Normally it’s quite warm. Besides that, I have to say it actually went quite smooth. Of course we didn’t really have a lot of information about the tyres but I never really had a lot of issues throughout the race, in terms of feedback or that there was something weird going on with the tyres so it was pretty straightforward."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, I think the lack of practice, I think, made it more challenging, I think, for all of us, every single one of us. I’m quite happy to not do a Friday. I love driving but there are lots of positives that come from it. One, there’s 22 days less of 20 cars bombing around the track and polluting the air, the planet, so that’s a positive but secondly, I think it just made it so much harder for us. We had to really… normally you have two sessions on the Friday, you get time to make tons of different set-up changes and if you’re on the back foot you’ve got time to catch up, you’ve got so much analysis to do and watching videos and all this stuff. When you start on a Saturday, you’ve got no time. You’ve got that one session to really get on top of it and the set-up between practice and qualifying. It made it so hard but the race was… for me, the race was incredibly difficult, I think, today, with conditions being so cold, the restarts. The tyres were not working for me, particularly when I came out after the pit stops. I had a good gap to you (Max) but then you nearly had me, you were catching me and I was struggling so much on the newer tyres. And then we got the safety car; I don’t know why it goes so slow but maybe it’s because everyone’s got to catch up, whatever it was. And then they let everyone by, and I’m jeez, I’m going to be here a long time…"
Max VERSTAPPEN, Did they have the advantage of having warm tyres?
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, it was definitely difficult but we’re all in the same boat so I’m not complaining but it definitely made it harder, these conditions and temperatures we had today."
Daniel RICCIARDO, I agree on everything. I’m wearing two pairs of socks.
Max VERSTAPPEN, Two?
Daniel RICCIARDO," Yeah, I put two pairs of socks on today."
Max VERSTAPPEN, Daniel’s not made for the cold.
Daniel RICCIARDO, So I’ve got two pairs of socks on.
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, they’re pretty thin anyway."
Daniel RICCIARDO," Yeah, they’re thin, so I kept my feet warm, but I think having the challenge of two day weekends, I like that. So happy, obviously, to do it again in Imola."
Max VERSTAPPEN, You must have a hole in your nose box or something.
Daniel RICCIARDO, I just feel the cold.
Max VERSTAPPEN, There might be a trick somewhere there in the nose.
Daniel RICCIARDO, Please don’t protest! Not today!
Lewis HAMILTON, Are you allowed to wear two socks?
Alex Albon," Yeah, it was good. Obviously, a while to get here but no, it was a tough one as well, we had to work for it. But no, I’m really happy. I’m really happy. I can breathe. It feels nice to be here."
Alex Albon," Actually, surprisingly OK. I was expecting it to be worse. But we had two red flags so that did help it. It’s brutal, especially the high speeds in Sector 2, you feel it. Otherwise I think there was more adrenaline going into my body than anything else, so I’m happy."
Alex Albon," Yeah, it was good. We just couldn’t get off the line so most of the overtakes I had to get it done on the circuit. But our car is good on the brakes, we’ve known that since day one so we can do moves like that and it’s fun to drive."
Valtteri BOTTAS," It’s disappointing as obviously it was like a dream start for me for the race. The start was really good and I also managed to hold pole position for the safety car restart. I don’t really remember all the phases but it seemed there were no opportunities once I lost position at the second start, but that’s how it goes."
Valtteri BOTTAS, I’ll just keep pushing. I’ll keep pushing and keep trying to get better. It has to turn out well for me at some point.
Valtteri BOTTAS," I don’t know. I’ve lost many qualifyings this year with just a few hundredths so I think that’s the first thing,  to try to get those few hundredths to my side."
Lewis HAMILTON," Well, it’s all a bit of a daze. It was like three races in one day. Just incredibly tough today. I think obviously with a difficult start. This track is phenomenal. The heat. Keeping Valtteri behind me, who’s been quick all weekend was not easy, and obviously I was behind him at the beginning. All those restarts and the total focus needed during that time. It was really, really hard."
Lewis HAMILTON," Not really. It was those restarts. The first stint I was fine, managing my tyres and I didn’t need to stop. It was just they were worried because Valtteri had a problem and then you obviously see the things unravelling those next laps and the last one I started on the softs, which was a used tyre, and not knowing how far that was going to go. And then Valtteri appeared out of nowhere, when I saw Danny was behind, and he was on it. There were times when I was looking after the tyres and all of a sudden he would close up. So keeping that over one-second gap, because this is a long, long straight, it’s a thousand metres or whatever it is, and I didn’t want him to have DRS. My heart is definitely racing and it’s crazy to be here and have 90 grand prix victories and uh… justice for Breonna Taylor."
Lewis HAMILTON," Hectic! Such a rollercoaster ride, I think, mentally and emotionally. Emotionally and physically, sorry. All these guys have done an amazing job. Valtteri was so quick all weekend so keeping him behind in the starts and stops we had, I wouldn’t say it was easy to stay in the zone. But really, really grateful to the team for running up and down the pit lane, I think we had the furthest to go. For their composure, I think they did an amazing job. Really proud to be a part of it. Ultimately really proud of my performance today because it was not easy keeping these guys behind."
Valtteri BOTTAS, For sure it’s disappointing. I think frustrating is not the right word because I felt I really tried everything. At least the first part. The first race start was absolutely perfect and the restart I managed to keep my position and felt like the pace was good. Once I lost the position to Lewis at the second start I tried everything I could to get it back but I couldn’t and he obviously was faultless today and it was a pretty crazy race. It really feels like we had three races today instead of one. I tried and I feel it’s just a matter to time that things will go my way and it will come and I will keep pushing.
Alex Albon, Yeah. It was a good race obviously. It was nice to finally get that podium but under the circumstances as well. It was a tricky race. We weren’t very good off the line so a lot of the overtakes had to be on the track. It made it exciting. We had a really good car today and fortunately we were able to extract it and do the overtakes when we needed to.
Lewis HAMILTON," Not much of a change, it’s still fighting the same thing. It’s just… it took me a long time to get that shirt and I’ve been wanting to wear that and bring awareness to the fact that there’s people that have been killed on the street and there’s someone that got killed in her own house, and they’re in the wrong house, and those guys are still walking free and we can’t rest, we can’t… we have to continue to raise awareness with it and Naomi has been doing amazing, so huge congratulations to here, and I think she’s an incredible inspiration with what she’s done with her platform. I think we just have to continue to push on the issue."
Alex Albon," It wasn’t easy. When you lose positions at the start you always feel like it’s going to be more hard work but you never doubt that you can get back up there. It wasn’t an easy track to overtake. On the first stint I used a lot of my tyres to overtake, I think it was two cars, or whoever I did overtake and on the Mediums we were actually strong. I knew the pace was there – I was just a bit afraid because, with another red flag, it meant I would have been happy just to maintain position but the Renaults seemed to be very strong at starts and the Racing Point was also strong. I was fired up when we lost another two positions – or another position off the start – but I knew also that we had the pace. It was more about patience during the race and making sure you don’t overdrive the car too early, the tyres too early, so you had something left for the overtaking later on. And yeah, with Daniel… we were good in the last corner. That was… we’ve been good in the last sector all weekend and that’s really important for a circuit where there’s only one place to overtake and that’s Turn One. The Renaults are quick down the straights so I didn’t catch him as quick as I thought I would, and it was kind of like a last-minute dive on the outside. Of course, I was a little worried, but I left enough space and Daniel gave me enough room and I went past."
Valtteri BOTTAS," We’re allowed to race from the control line, which has been there for a while, I think. Just the difference this year has been the Safety Car, they are putting the lights off quite late, so you can only build the gap pretty late on. So, of course when you’re in the lead you try to maximise your chances and I’m not at all to blame for that. Everyone can look at everything they want for it. I was doing consistent speed until I went. Yes, I went late but we start racing from the control line, not before that. So the guys behind who crashed because of that, they can look in the mirror. There’s no point whining about it. It’s just… the FIA or FOM, I don’t know who’s deciding what’s happening with the Safety Cars but they’re trying to make the show better by turning the lights later, so we can’t build a gap early and then go like the corner before the race start. They in the main straight, so maybe it’s time to think if that’s right and safe to do so."
Lewis HAMILTON," Firstly, it’s absolutely not Valtteri’s fault at all. It’s the decision-makers. I don’t know who. They’re obviously trying to make it more exciting but ultimately today you’ve seen they’ve put people at risk. So, perhaps they need to rethink that. They have been moving switching off the Safety Car lights later and later and later and we’re out there fighting for a position. Especially when you earn a position like Valtteri earned the position of being in the lead and then obviously they are trying to make it more exciting – but today was a little bit over the limit perhaps. But he did exactly what anyone would do."
Alex Albon," Same comments as Lewis and Valtteri. I think when you put the control lines so far in front and then also leave the lights so late it’s pretty obvious where Valtteri’s going to take off. He’s going to take off as late as he can and I imagine the midfield know when Valtteri’s going to go and they are also trying to get a slingshot and then when Valtteri doesn’t go when they think he’s going to go, that’s when the concertina happens and it’s dangerous but it’s predictable as well in that sense because the closer you leave it or the less time you leave, let Valtteri decide when to take off, the more obvious… the shorter time he has to go so it’s quite easy to read. I don’t know if you saw but the top five were all almost doing a double formation start because we were all just waiting for the take-off. It’s dangerous. I think tracks like this are always going to be difficult as well, with long straights but definitely something could have been done better."
Lewis HAMILTON," So the first one… every situation is different so I just went too deep and got wheelspin, wasn’t very good reaction also so Valtteri beat us off there. The second one, yeah, I basically had on the formation lap… I had a separation of my front brake temperatures by nearly two hundred degrees so I was pushing them very hard to bring the one that was down equal, and I got them up to a thousand degrees and I tried to cool them through the last corner and all the way to the start and I got to the grid and there was a lot of smoke coming and I was definitely worried as I could see… I think I saw a flame at one stage which is not good, because that burns all the interior of what is in the upright so fortunately the start was… got under way relatively quickly and I didn’t have a problem from there on but it was definitely on the limit."
Lewis HAMILTON, I don’t remember. Has it been brought up? I can’t remember.
Valtteri BOTTAS," I know that I think our team opened up the discussion again this morning before the race, saying that it’s a bit of a concern here, but they said basically they’re going to keep doing it because it’s better for the show. I think that was the reply."
Lewis HAMILTON," Yeah, it just doesn’t seem real. Obviously it’s ultimately a privilege to be in a position and have such a great team and a car to be able to deliver weekend in, weekend out but I just feel forever grateful to the people that continue to work hard, I’m just a link in the chain but getting the wins is not easy when you have a great driver in Valtteri pushing you the limit, weekend in, weekend out. But I never thought that I would be here, that’s for sure."
Lewis HAMILTON," I personally love it, I don’t know how it was for the racing but it was one of the toughest tracks to drive, I think being that it’s medium and high speed but it’s a fantastic circuit and I don’t think it was too dangerous, I think it’s more old-school with the run-off areas and the gravel so I hope they don’t change that and I would love to come back."
Valtteri BOTTAS," Yeah, I think it’s great, I think it should be in the calendar every year. It’s definitely goes really high up in my list so it’s not too dangerous. Well, motor sport is dangerous, that’s how it goes but it’s an old school track and we all love it."
Alex Albon," Yeah, personally I really love the circuit. I think it’s nice to go to these tracks which aren’t your normal run-off area, let’s say mistake-free tracks. Here it was a bit more punishing and it just feels a bit more special as well to come to these unique old places where there’s a lot of history behind it."
Lewis HAMILTON," I don’t know. I need to think about and I don’t want to overstep the mark so I know the fans were excited with the last race, with the restart and everything so it seemed like they… if there’s a piece of paper on the track they’re going to put the red flag out and do a restart and I can understand why and that is exciting. Ultimately, these races can get boring when everyone streams out and there’s such big gaps between everyone and so this does bring it back it in. They do it in NASCAR, the put out the yellow flag all the time and safety cars, whatever, all the time to keep the race exciting, but they definitely need to take into account the safety aspect because today wasn’t particularly safe with the restart. I could almost see that coming. I’m sure they will learn from it and we will move together, the sport together."
Valtteri BOTTAS, Nothing to add. I agree with that absolutely.
